Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

 
SOLUTION:

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null)
            return null;
        if(root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val)
            return root;
        else if(root.val < Math.min(p.val,q.val))
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        else if(root.val > Math.max(p.val,q.val))
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        return root;
    }
}

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 
SOLUTIONS:

class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split("\\s");
        int n = words.length;
        List<String> newWords = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            words[i] = words[i].trim();
            if(!words[i].equals(""))
                newWords.add(words[i]);
        }
        System.out.println(n);
        int lo =0;int hi = n-1;
        Collections.reverse(newWords);
        String result = String.join(" ", newWords);
        return result;
    }
}

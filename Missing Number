Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?


SOLUTION:


class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int sum = (n*(n+1))/2;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum-= nums[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
